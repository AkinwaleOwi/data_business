Project management has its own “greatest hits” when it comes to charts. These show time, progress, resources, and risk—the stuff PMs live and breathe. Here are the most common ones 👇

0. Gantt Chart

What it shows: Tasks over time, dependencies, milestones
Used for: Project planning, scheduling, tracking progress
👉 The classic PM chart. If someone says “project chart,” this is usually it.

1. Timeline / Milestone Chart

What it shows: Key dates and milestones
Used for: Executive updates, roadmaps
👉 Cleaner and less detailed than a Gantt—great for stakeholders.

2. Kanban Board

What it shows: Work status (To Do → In Progress → Done)
Used for: Agile and operational project tracking
👉 Visual, flexible, and very popular with software teams.

3. Burndown Chart

What it shows: Work remaining vs. time
Used for: Agile / Scrum sprints
👉 Instantly tells you if the team is ahead or behind.

4. Burnup Chart

What it shows: Work completed vs. total scope
Used for: Agile projects with changing scope
👉 Better than burndown when scope creep is a thing (so… always).

5. Resource Allocation Chart

What it shows: Who is working on what and when
Used for: Capacity planning, workload balancing
👉 Helps prevent overallocation and burnout.

6. RACI Matrix (chart/table)

What it shows: Roles and responsibilities
Used for: Clarifying ownership
👉 Not flashy, but it saves projects from chaos.

7. Critical Path Diagram

What it shows: Longest sequence of dependent tasks
Used for: Schedule risk analysis
👉 Tells you what cannot slip without delaying the project.

8. Risk Matrix / Heat Map

What it shows: Risk probability vs. impact
Used for: Risk management
👉 Simple, visual, and exec-friendly.

9. Status Dashboard

What it shows: Overall health (schedule, cost, scope, risks)
Used for: Steering committees, leadership updates
👉 Usually a combo of charts + red/yellow/green indicators.

10. Earned Value Charts (EVM)

What they show: Planned vs. actual vs. earned value
Used for: Cost & schedule performance
👉 Common in large, regulated, or government projects.

=====================================================================
If you want, tell me:

Agile or Waterfall?

Team vs. exec audience?

Planning or reporting?

I’ll narrow this down to the 2–3 charts you actually need, not the whole zoo.
