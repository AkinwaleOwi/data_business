list of the most common charts used in business
====================================
Here are the most common charts used in business, what they’re good for, and when people usually reach for them 👇

0. Bar / Column Chart

Best for: Comparing values across categories
Typical uses: Sales by product, revenue by region, expenses by department
👉 Easy to read, exec-friendly, probably the most used chart in business.

1. Line Chart

Best for: Trends over time
Typical uses: Monthly sales, stock prices, website traffic, KPIs over time
👉 Perfect when time is involved and you want to show growth, decline, or seasonality.

2. Pie Chart

Best for: Showing parts of a whole
Typical uses: Market share, budget allocation
👉 Works only when there are few categories. Overused and often misused 😅

3. Stacked Bar / Stacked Column

Best for: Comparing totals and composition
Typical uses: Revenue by region split by product line
👉 Good for storytelling, but can get messy if there are many segments.

4. Area Chart

Best for: Trends + magnitude over time
Typical uses: Cumulative sales, user growth
👉 Like a line chart, but with more visual “weight.”

5. Scatter Plot

Best for: Relationships between variables
Typical uses: Price vs. demand, ad spend vs. conversions
👉 Great for analysis and spotting correlations (and outliers).

6. Histogram

Best for: Distribution of data
Typical uses: Customer age distribution, delivery times
👉 Popular with analysts, less so in exec decks.

7. Waterfall Chart

Best for: Showing how a starting value changes step by step
Typical uses: Profit breakdown, cash flow analysis
👉 A finance team favorite.

8. Table (yes, really)

Best for: Exact values
Typical uses: Financial statements, detailed reports
👉 Not flashy, but often necessary.

9. Dashboard Combo (mixed charts)

Best for: Monitoring performance
Typical uses: Executive dashboards, KPI tracking
👉 Usually a mix of bar, line, and KPI tiles.

If you want, tell me what you’re presenting (finance, marketing, ops, strategy) and who the audience is—I can recommend the best chart instead of just the common ones.
