Game dev uses a mix of production, design, tech, and live-ops charts—some look like classic project management, others are very game-specific. Here are the ones you’ll see most often 👇

Production & Scheduling
0. Gantt / Roadmap Chart

Used for: Milestones, feature delivery, release planning
👉 Vertical slices, alpha/beta, content drops—same PM DNA, different flavor.

1. Sprint Burndown / Burnup

Used for: Agile teams (especially engineering)
👉 Tracks progress during sprints and feature pushes.

2. Kanban Board

Used for: Art, design, QA, and live-ops tasks
👉 Great for assets flowing through concept → modeling → polish → done.

Game Design & Balancing
3. Progression Curves (Line Charts)

Used for: XP curves, leveling speed, difficulty scaling
👉 One of the most important charts in game design.

4. Economy Flow Charts

Used for: Currency sources & sinks
👉 Helps prevent inflation, grind, or pay-to-win disasters.

5.Damage / Power Curves

Used for: Weapon balance, character scaling
👉 Shows when something breaks the game at mid or late levels.

6. Funnel Charts

Used for: Player progression (tutorial → early game → endgame)
👉 Highlights where players drop off.

Analytics & Player Behavior
7. Retention Curves

Used for: D1 / D7 / D30 retention
👉 Live-service teams obsess over these.

8. Cohort Analysis Charts

Used for: Comparing player groups over time
👉 Essential for updates, events, and monetization tuning.

9. Heatmaps

Used for: Player movement, deaths, interactions
👉 Level design gold—shows what players actually do.

10. Session Length Distribution (Histogram)

Used for: Engagement analysis
👉 Tells you if sessions feel snackable or exhausting.

Performance & Technical
11. Frame Time / FPS Graphs

Used for: Performance optimization
👉 Spikes = stutters players will notice.

12. Memory Usage Charts

Used for: Console & mobile constraints
👉 Very unglamorous, very critical.

13. Load Time Charts

Used for: UX and platform certification
👉 Seconds matter more than you think.

QA & Live Ops
14. Bug Trend Charts

Used for: Open vs. closed bugs over time
👉 Shows whether QA is winning or drowning.

15. Crash Rate Charts

Used for: Stability tracking
👉 One of the fastest ways to kill retention if ignored.

16. Event Performance Dashboards

Used for: Live events, seasons, battle passes
👉 Combines revenue, engagement, and retention charts.

Executive / Stakeholder Views
17. KPI Dashboards

Common metrics: DAU, MAU, ARPDAU, retention, revenue
👉 Usually a combo of line charts, bars, and big-number tiles.

If you want, tell me:

Indie vs AAA

Single-player vs live service

Design, production, analytics, or tech focus

I’ll narrow this down to the charts you actually need for your game, not the whole studio wall 📊🎮
