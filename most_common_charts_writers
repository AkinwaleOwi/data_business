most common charts for writers

Writers don’t always think in “charts,” but once you start tracking story, process, or audience, a few visuals show up over and over. Here are the most common charts writers actually use 👇

Story & Craft
0. Story Arc / Plot Curve

What it shows: Tension over time (exposition → climax → resolution)
👉 Classic Freytag’s Pyramid. Great for pacing and structure.

1. Character Arc Chart

What it shows: Emotional, moral, or psychological change over the story
👉 Helps make sure characters actually evolve.

2. Timeline Chart

What it shows: Events in chronological order
👉 Essential for complex plots, flashbacks, or multiple POVs.

3. Scene-by-Scene Outline (Table / Flow Chart)

What it shows: Scene purpose, POV, conflict, outcome
👉 Less visual, more practical — widely used.

Productivity & Process
4. Word Count Progress Chart

What it shows: Words written over time
👉 NaNoWriMo’s favorite chart.

5. Deadline / Milestone Chart

What it shows: Drafts, revisions, submissions
👉 Keeps long projects from drifting forever.

6. Habit Streak Charts

What it shows: Daily or weekly writing consistency
👉 Surprisingly motivating.

Revision & Quality
7. Revision Pass Tracker

What it shows: Which aspects are fixed per draft (plot, pacing, prose)

8. Pacing Chart

What it shows: Scene length or intensity across chapters
👉 Highlights slow spots and rushed climaxes.

Publishing & Audience (Especially for Online Writers)

“Unofficial but Common” Visuals
