most common charts in cyber security


Cybersecurity has its own “usual suspects” when it comes to charts — they’re all about threats, risk, time, and impact. Here are the most common charts you’ll see in SOCs, security reports, and exec decks 👇

Threat & Incident Monitoring
0. Time-Series Line Charts

Used for: Security events over time
Examples: Failed logins, malware detections, IDS alerts
👉 Great for spotting spikes, attacks, and trends.

1. Bar Charts

Used for: Comparing categories
Examples: Top attack types, most targeted assets, incidents by severity
👉 Simple, readable, and heavily used in reports.

2. Stacked Bar Charts

Used for: Composition over time
Examples: Alerts by severity per week, attack types per system
👉 Helps show both volume and mix.

Risk & Vulnerability Management
3. Risk Matrix / Heat Map

Used for: Likelihood vs. impact
Examples: Vulnerability risk, third-party risk
👉 One of the most exec-friendly visuals in security.

4. Vulnerability Age Charts

Used for: Time to remediate
Examples: Open vulnerabilities by age bucket
👉 Quickly exposes patching problems.

5. CVSS Distribution Charts

Used for: Severity breakdown
Examples: Count of vulnerabilities by CVSS score
👉 Common in vulnerability management dashboards.

Incident Response & SOC Operations
6. Incident Timeline Charts

Used for: Attack progression and response
Examples: Detection → containment → eradication → recovery
👉 Critical for post-incident reviews.

7. Mean Time Charts (MTTD / MTTR)

Used for: Detection and response performance
Examples: Average time to detect/respond over time
👉 Core SOC KPIs.

8. Queue / Backlog Charts

Used for: Alert backlog and analyst workload
👉 Helps prevent SOC burnout and missed alerts.

Network & Attack Visualization
9. Network Traffic Flow Charts

Used for: East-west and north-south traffic
Examples: Unusual data exfiltration patterns
👉 Especially common in NDR tools.

10. Geo Maps

Used for: Source of attacks by country/region
👉 Flashy and popular — but often more eye candy than insight 😅

Compliance & Governance
11. Control Coverage Charts

Used for: Security control implementation
Examples: Controls implemented vs. missing
👉 Common in audits and compliance reviews.

12. Compliance Status Dashboards

Used for: Frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST, SOC 2
👉 Often traffic-light (red/yellow/green) visuals.

Executive & Board Reporting
13. Security KPI Dashboards

Common metrics:

14. Incidents by severity

15. Risk score trends

16. Patch compliance

17. MTTD / MTTR

👉 Usually a combo of line charts, bars, and heat maps, not deep technical detail.

Less Common but Powerful
18. Attack Kill Chain Charts

Used for: Mapping attacks to MITRE ATT&CK stages
👉 Great for gap analysis and defense planning.

If you want, tell me:

SOC / Blue Team / GRC / Executive audience

Operational monitoring or reporting

Cloud, enterprise, or OT environment

I’ll cut this down to the 5 charts that matter most for your role, not the entire SIEM zoo 🔐📊
